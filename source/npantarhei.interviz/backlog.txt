::Add backward/forward navigation thru jumps to flows via the combo box
-provide a list of nodes navigated to; maybe via a menu item?


::Provide navigation to flows by clicking on flow nodes in graph
-see GraphViz "plain" output format for information on node positions
-integrate graphical navigation with backward/forward navigation


::Load flow from assembly resources


::Display comments in graph. But only comments in the same line as a flow name or stream, e.g.

// dont display this comment
F // but display this
.in, A
A, B // and display this
B, .out

Where should flow name comments go in the graph? In the box or next to the box?
Stream comments can become labels of edges.


::Word wrap flow names in their boxes.
A first attempt failed - but maybe it still can be made to work?


::Allow sorting of flow names in combobox: alphabetically or in order of definition.


::Display all flow ports on the same level in graph (on top/bottom of flow).


::Provide drill down on graph. Does GraphViz deliver box coordinates?
